## [2.0.0] — 2026-03-16

### Added
- **19 new vulnerability plugins** (41 → 60 total) across all 4 tools:
  - **Promptfoo** (15 → 21): SSRF, Excessive Agency, Competitor Endorsement, Brand Imitation, Misinformation/Disinformation, Copyright Violations
  - **Garak** (12 → 17): RealToxicityPrompts, Package Hallucination, Do-Not-Answer Compliance, Language Model Risk Cards, Emotional Manipulation (Grandma)
  - **PyRIT** (6 → 9): Tree of Attacks with Pruning (TAP), Cross-Domain Prompt Injection (XPIA), FlipAttack Encoding Bypass
  - **DeepTeam** (8 → 13): Political Bias, Religion Bias, Input Hijacking, PII Session Leakage, Health Misinformation
- **Settings page: SMTP configuration** — admins can configure SMTP from the web UI with "Send Test Email" button. DB settings take precedence over env vars.
- **Settings page: AI Remediation provider** — configure a default AI provider (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, or custom endpoint) for remediation across all projects, with per-project override and model auto-detection.
- **`appSettings` database table** — key-value store with AES-256-CBC encryption for sensitive values.
- **Endpoint Auto-Bridge** — zero-config local model scanning; `localhost` endpoints automatically bridged into Docker workers.
- **`OLLAMA_TIMEOUT` env var** — configurable Ollama timeout (default 900s / 15 min).
- **`OLLAMA_URL` env var** — override Ollama endpoint for Docker deployments.
- **`EART_APP_URL` env var** — worker→app communication URL (auto-set in docker-compose).
- **Full test suite** — backend unit/integration tests (Vitest + Supertest), frontend component tests (Vitest + React Testing Library), E2E tests (Playwright).
- **Install scripts** — `scripts/install.sh` (Linux/macOS) and `scripts/install.bat` (Windows).
- **CI pipeline** — GitHub Actions: type-check, tests, build on every push/PR.
- **Free vs Pro tier** — README now clearly documents the free tier (5 scans/month, Quick preset, watermarked PDFs) and Pro license ($79 one-time).

### Changed
- **Dependency upgrade to latest majors**: Express 4→5, React 18→19, Tailwind CSS 3→4, Vite 6→7, Zod 3→4, Drizzle ORM 0.38→0.45, Recharts 2→3, React Router 6→7, and many more.
- **Quick Scan preset** expanded from 8 to 10 plugins (added Excessive Agency, RealToxicityPrompts).
- **OWASP preset** expanded to 22 plugins with broader LLM02, LLM08, LLM09, LLM10 coverage.
- **Full Enterprise Scan** covers all 60 plugins.
- **Garak** version requirement bumped to >=0.14.0; **PyRIT** to >=0.11.0.
- **Ollama timeout** increased from 5 min to 15 min (configurable via `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT`).
- **Tailwind CSS 4 migration** — CSS `@theme` directives replace JS config; `@tailwindcss/vite` replaces PostCSS plugin.
- **Express 5 migration** — updated `AuthenticatedRequest` params type, modernized error handler.
- Extracted shared utilities: `attackPatterns.ts`, `helpers.ts`, `constants.ts`, `aiProvider.ts`.
- Python security workers now build by default with `docker compose build` (no longer behind `--profile workers`).

### Fixed
- **Scans against OpenAI-compatible endpoints return empty responses** — bypassed promptfoo's HTTP provider for custom endpoints; added empty response detection.
- **Switching AI provider doesn't clear stale settings** — frontend clears provider-specific fields on switch; backend sanitizes config.
- **OpenAI/Anthropic remediation fails with wrong model name** — removed hardcoded `"llama3"` fallback; each provider now uses its own default.
- **Ollama unreachable from Docker** — all provider URLs now resolve through `resolveForHost()`.
- **Progress bar jumps to 100% immediately** — pre-calculates expected test count; tracks dedicated `progress` column.
- **Critical camelCase/snake_case config mismatch** — `dockerRunner.ts` now sends snake_case keys to Python workers.
- **Docker cross-platform networking** — replaced `--network=host` with `--add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway`.
